		uman Skin Tone Detection is a website where one can detect
		the skin tone from a human face image. The website simply takes an input and uses image processing techniques to
		process the image as per requirements and results whether a skin is Fair, Mild or Dark.Human skin detection
		plays a key role in human-computer interactions. As we can see that there are so many new technological
		advancements happening such as biometric authentication in our smart phones for face detection, adult content
		filtering, hand gesture recognition is a modern way of human computer interaction i.e., we can control our
		system by showing our hands in front of webcam and hand gesture recognition can be useful for all kinds of
		people. Based upon this idea of skin detection this website is presented.
		<br><br>
		Skin detection is the process of finding skin-colored pixels and regions in an image or a video. This process is
		typically used as a preprocessing step to find regions that potentially have human faces and limbs in images.
		Several computer vision approaches have been developed for skin detection. A skin detector typically transforms
		a given pixel into an appropriate color space and then use a skin classifier to label the pixel whether it is a
		skin or a non-skin pixel. A skin classifier defines a decision boundary of the skin color class in the color
		space based on a training database of skin-colored pixels.

		Human skin detection is an essential phase in face detection and face recognition when using color images. Skin
		detection is very challenging because of the differences in illumination, differences in photos taken using an
		assortment of cameras with their own characteristics, range of skin colors due to different ethnicities, and
		other variations. Numerous methods have been used for human skin color detection, including the Gaussian model,
		rule-based methods, and artificial neural networks. 
		<br><br>
		An active area of research in image processing is face recognition, i.e., the ability to recognize a face and
		identify the person. Face recognition relies on detecting the face in the image, and the first phase of face
		detection in color images is segmentation of the image into human skin and non-human skin. This segmentation is
		challenging because of the differences of illumination between images, use of different cameras in taking the
		images, different characteristics of various lenses, and range of human skin colors due to ethnicity. One of the
		most important issues is that some pixels are common between human skin and other entities such as soil, desk
		surfaces, walls, and other items. These challenges make image processing of skin color detection very difficult,
		and there is no exact mechanism to distinguish between skin color and non-skin color.
		<br><br>
		For skin detection, a color space must be chosen. There are a number of color spaces that can be used for skin
		detection. The most common color spaces are RGB, YCbCr, and HSV. Each of these color spaces has its own
		characteristic. Combining of information is a strong method that is being used in data processing. One of the
		most important advantages of combining information is that not only the useful information from the vectors are
		kept but also the redundant information are omitted.
